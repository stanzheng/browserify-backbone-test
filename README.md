# browserify-backbone-test
Mocking out a backbone app built using Browserify.

Served up by grunt in a local development environment, so requires Node and NPM and such.  If you don't have grunt-cli installed, get that first too.

```
npm install
grunt
```

Grunt will open your favorite browser, and livereload is watching the project flders.
